			<p>Welcome to Pathfinder! One of the most complicated systems out there. The system features over one hundred classes, tons of feats, multiple races, and thousands of options to create your character. As with most things, the more ways there are to create your character, the more complicated it all gets. Lucky for us, Pathfinder: Kingmaker only implemented about one tenth of the rule set. So our focus is only going to be based on what’s actually in the game.<br><br>They say the first boss of the game is the character creation system itself. Hopefully, with the knowledge you gain here. You will be able to slay that notorious boss and get on your way to experiencing one of the best video game out there! </p>

		<div class="text" id="Mechanics">
			<h1 style="color: #393939">General Mechanics:</h1>
			<p>Before creating your character, you must first have an idea of what it is you want your character to be. What roles in the party do you want your character to focus on? How do you plan your character to function in terms of gameplay? Do you want your character to focus on weapons, ranged weapons, maybe you want your character to fling spells instead. Or perhaps you fancy being the support of the group. These questions are necessary as it will help you flesh out your character, and give you a better sense of how to develop your character. Okay, with that out of the way, before we can even talk about anything else; we must understand a couple of key fundamentals. Understanding these fundamentals are essential for building your character.</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Base Attack Bonus (BAB):<br>BAB essentially refers to your inherent ability to hit an enemy. This bonus is derived from the respective class you have levels in. The main important thing here with BAB is that when it reaches +6 you get an additional attack. And for every +5 thereafter you get an additional attack as well. Meaning you get even more attempts to whack an enemy in a round! So higher is better. On top of BAB there are additional bonuses that can be applied, such as STR bonuses, Flanking, and so on. These bonuses are referred to as Attack Bonuses or AB for short. Attack bonuses stack with BAB.</li><br>
				<li>Difficulty Check (DC):<br>This one is simple to understand. Whenever you’re making an action that is based on a dice roll. Your character will attempt to make a check. The check is a sum of all relevant bonuses + a 20 sided dice roll (Or d20 for short). Persuading the local shop keeper to give you a lower discount is an example of a DC. As this instance will require you to make dice roll + any bonuses to persuasions, such as CHA.</li><br>
				<li>Armor Class (AC):<br>If you’re planning on going toe to toe with your enemies, then you will also have to know the significance of AC. AC is super important in close melee combat. As it is the main factor in determining whether or not you get hit. However, AC isn’t the only sole factor in damage mitigation. As there are other ways to either completely avoid damage, or to mitigate damage; but for now just know that AC is what determines whether or not an enemy can land an attack on you. Another to consider is that unlike AC, touch AC does not include armor, shield, or any natural armor bonuses. Other bonuses such as size modifier, DEX modifier, and deflection bonus still apply normally in regards to touch AC.</li><br>
				<li>Hit Points (HP):<br>This is how much health your character has. Basically how much damage your character can endure before collapsing.</li><br>
				<li>Initiative:<br>By far the most important concept. While its significance is lost when transiting to a Real Time environment, this mechanic is still vital. Consider the following, before combat starts, each unit on the battle field makes a roll. This roll is then added to current initiative bonuses. The unit with the highest acts first and vice versa. If a melee combatant acts before your melee units do, then your melee units will get caught flat footed. Incurring penalties to AC such as losing any DEX bonuses to AC (Uncanny Dodge completely mitigate this penalty). Moreover, characters that have a relatively low initiative will act last. So having a high initiative will help reduce such situations from occurring. Best way to improve initiative is through the feat “Improved Initiative” and having a high DEX (If possible).</li><br>
				<li>Damage Reduction (DR):<br> If you plan on whacking anything with a weapon, then you absolutely need to know what DR is. In Pathfinder: Kingmaker there exists certain enemies that are able to ignore inflicted damage. At times this just means you need to bring a weapon with a high enhancement value. For example, to overcome an enemy that has the Cold Iron/Silver DR type, you will need to have a weapon that has at least a plus three enhancement value. For an enemy that has the adamantine type, you will need a weapon with a plus five enhancement value. Finally if an enemy has an alignment DR type then you will need a weapon with a plus five enhancement value. Yet, this isn’t a fool proof plan. As some enemies can, when specified with a DR/-, can ignore the amount of damage regardless of how mighty your magical weapon is.</li><br>
				<li>Critical Hits/Confirmation:<br> Every once in a while your character is going to make a critical hit against an enemy. Resulting in a lot of damage. Great! But how does it work? Well, certain weapons have different threat ranges. A threat range means that if you make a roll within the specified numerical range, you will then roll again to confirm the critical. So let’s say my long sword of DOOM! Has a threat range of 18-20, and I roll an 18 when attempting to hit an enemy. I will then roll again to confirm my critical against the enemy. This roll just needs to be high enough to hit in order for the critical to confirm. What occurs next is that my damage is then multiplied by twice. As my long sword of DOOM has a x2 on critical (Make sure to check your weapon for further information in regards to how much damage gets multiplied on critical hits. As certain weapons have different critical multiplier properties.). Now, let’s say I roll a 20; well in that case the critical is automatically confirmed as a 20 always hit regardless.<br><br>Wonderful! But how do I make my character crit more often? Picking the feat “Improved Critical”, or wielding a weapon with a low threat range will help. Also having a weapon with the “Keen” enchantment will help as well. However, do be noted that “Keen” and “Improved Critical” do not stack with each other.</li><br>
				<li>Attack of Opportunity (AoO):<br>Ah yes! It is time for my favorite mechanic in Pathfinder: Kingmaker. AoO stacking! If you’re a melee combatant you benefit greatly from this mechanic. If you’re a ranged martial however, you gain no benefits from this mechanic, sadly. Nonetheless what is an Attack of Opportunity? When certain conditions are met you’re able to make an immediate and free attack against an enemy.. This attack receives the same bonuses as your regular attacks and can intterupt enemy actions. The conditions for an AoO to proc are:<br><br>1) A spellcaster who attempts to cast while multiple melee units are in melee engagement with the caster.<br>2) Having an enemy attempt to stand up while being prone.<br>3) When an enemy, of whom is in melee engagement, attempts to break away from engagement by moving away. (Try using the “Acrobatics skill” if you’re trying to move away from an enemy during engagement. The skill forces you to move at half speed. The compromise is that you roll a mobility check instead of eating an AoO.)<br>4)If you have the “Outflank” feat you can cause an AoO to proc when a critical hit occurs.<br><br>Additionally, any actions that an enemy performs while being “threatened” (Threatened refers to any areas you can make a melee attack on.) can also cause AoOs to occur. In general you can only make one AoO. But this can be increased with the following feats; “Outflank”, “Combat Reflexes”, and “Size the Moment”.  With these three feats your melee combatants will be able to slice and dice enemies to little tiny pieces! If your build can’t afford all three, then consider having “Outflank” and “Combat Reflexes”.<br><br>Prerequisites for the aforementioned feats:<br>Outflank: BAB +4 (Teamwork feat. This means that other party members need to take this feat as well in order for it to work.)<br>Seize the Moment: Combat Reflexes and Improved Critical.<br>Improved Critical: Need to be proficient with a weapon(This just means taking the "Weapon Focus" feat). BAB +8.</li><br>
				<li>Bonuses/Stacking:<br>The last mechanic to be made aware of is how stacking works. In Pathfinder most bonuses do not stack with each other, save for special cases like dodge. Where it stacks with itself.  If you have bonuses that give the same effect, then only the bonus with the highest value will be used. So let’s say I have a belt that gives my monk a +4 Enhancement to STR and a ring that also gives my monk a +2 Enhancement to STR. In this specific case only the belt will be used. As both bonuses are of the same type - Enhancement. Here are other types of different bonuses you can expect to find Pathfinder: Kingmaker(The bonus type usually explicitly tells you if it stacks or not. If it doesn't say, then chances are it doesn't stack:
					<br><br><ul style="list-style: none;">
						<li>Alchemical: An alchemical bonus is granted by the use of a non-magical, alchemical substance such as antitoxin.</li>
						<br><li>Armor: An armor bonus applies to armor class and is granted by armor or by a spell or magical effect that mimics armor. Armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to armor class (even with natural armor bonuses) except other armor bonuses. An armor bonus doesn’t apply against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Circumstance: Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.</li>
						<br><li>Competence: A competence bonus affects a character’s performance of a particular task, as in the case of the bardic ability to inspire competence. Multiple competence bonuses don’t stack; only the highest bonus applies.</li>
						<br><li>Deflection: A deflection bonus affects armor class and is granted by a spell or magic effect that makes attacks veer off harmlessly. Deflection bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses. A deflection bonus applies against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Dodge: A dodge bonus improves armor class. Dodge bonuses are usually not granted by spells or magic items. Any situation or effect that negates a character’s Dexterity bonus also negates any dodge bonuses the character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC, even other dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses apply against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Enhancement: An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of armor or natural armor, or the effectiveness of a weapon, or a general bonus to an ability score. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies. Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor’s bonus to AC, they don’t apply against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Insight: An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.</li>
						<br><li>Luck: A luck bonus represents good fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest luck bonus applies. </li>
						<br><li>Morale: A morale bonus represents the effects of greater hope, courage, and determination (or hopelessness, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty). Multiple morale bonuses on the same character do not stack. Only the highest morale bonus applies.</li>
						<br><li>Natural Armor: A natural armor bonus improves armor class resulting from a creature’s naturally tough hide. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to armor class (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Does not apply against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Profane: A profane bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of evil. Multiple profane bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest profane bonus applies.</li>
						<br><li>Resistance: A resistance bonus affects saving throws, providing extra protection against harm. Multiple resistance bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest resistance bonus applies.</li>
						<br><li>Sacred: A sacred bonus stems from the power of good. Multiple sacred bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest sacred bonus applies</li>
						<br><li>Shield: A shield bonus improves armor class and is granted by a shield or by a spell or magic effect that mimics a shield. Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other shield bonuses. A magic shield typically grants an enhancement bonus to the shield’s shield bonus, which has the effect of increasing the shield’s overall bonus to AC. Does not apply against touch attacks.</li>
						<br><li>Size: A size bonus or penalty is derived from a creature’s size category. Size modifiers of different kinds apply to armor class, attack rolls, Stealth checks, combat maneuver checks, and various other checks.</li>

			<p>If you’re planning to have your character use a weapon. Then it is imperative that you get one of these! Otherwise your characters won’t be performing to their best!</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Power Attack:<br> This feat is required for STR focused melee combatants. If you’re using a weapon that is close range, or a reach weapon(A reach weapon primarily refers to a melee weapon that has a longer reach than close range weapons. For example, a Glaive has a longer reach – 6ft to be precise – than a long sword – 2 ft.) . Then you need to take this feat. What this feat does is that it further increases how much damage you can do by +2. When your BAB reaches +4 and every +4 thereafter. The damage bonuses increases by +2. If an attack is made with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or even a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times STR modifier on damage rolls. Then the damage bonus gets increased by a whooping +50%. All of this sounds delicious! The trade off is that you’ll get a -1 to attack rolls (This penalty is increased when BAB reaches +4 and every +4 thereafter.) While the penalty sounds bad, it’s actually not that bad at all. It only hurts in the early game. Which is due to how little resources you have at the point of the game. As you reach the mid game and onwards, the penalty becomes trivial.
				<br>Prerequisites: 13 STR and 1 BAB.</li>
				<br><li>Deadly Aim:<br>If you’re not a melee combatant and are instead going to be shooting arrows from afar. Don’t worry! While you won’t be picking Power Attack. Deadly Aim is a mighty substitute for ranged martials! Just like Power Attack you take a -1 on attacks in order to gain a +2 to damage rolls. Bonuses and penalties are increased when BAB reaches +4 and every +4 thereafter. 
				<br>Prerequisites: 13 DEX and 1 BAB.</li>
				<br><li>Piranha Strike:<br>If you’re not planning to use STR and are instead choosing to specialize into DEX as a melee combatant then consider this feat. This is a great alternative for DEX melee users. It gives the same bonus from the last two feats. A -1 to attack rolls and a +2 to damage rolls, which both get increased when BAB reaches +4 and every +4 thereafter. 
				<br>Prerequisites: Weapon Finesse and 1 BAB.</li>

		<div class="text" id="Throws">
			<h1 style="color: #393939">Saving Throws:</h1>
			<p>In Pathfinder: Kingmaker there exists a group of spells that can put your party out of action, cause nauseation, daze, sickness, sleep; and a slew of other nasty debuffs. When this occurs your characters will be forced to roll a d20 roll + any bonuses relevant to that save throw. If successful your characters won’t be affected. If not successful your characters will have a rough time. Here are the relevant stats that will be used in such cases:</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Fortitude:<br>This is used in cases where a debuff will target your character’s vitality. The CON modifier is used for this saving throw.</li>
				<br><li>Reflex:<br>This is for when your character has to avoid an Area of Effect based attack, and other situations that require this saving throw. The DEX modifier is used for this saving throw.</li>
				<br><li>Will:<br>This is used for when a character is exposed to a mind influencing spell and or other mind effects. The WIS modifier is used for this saving throw.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We are now ready to slay the final boss! This section will give you two example builds, while also covering general tips. Do remember though. Half the fun in these games is trying out different things, and constantly tinkering with your build.</p>
			<p>Example STR Fighter:<br>
			Recommended stat distribution:<br>
			<br>STR 17/19/20 – 17 is the perfect point for builds that are dependent on multiple ability points (MAD for short). It is also good for builds that plan on investing in other stats for survivability. 19 is the breakpoint for stat optimization. As this allows you to put points in other areas. While 20 is the lest flexible in terms of stat optimization. The reason being that it doesn’t leave you with a lot of room to pump points into other areas. 20 into main stat is perfect for characters that are not going to be reliant on many stats. So if your build is only going to be dependent on 3-4 stats to function, then going 20 into main isn’t that bad of an idea.
			<br>Further explanation: Make sure you place all of your level up points (You get one every four levels. Totaling to 5.) into main stat. If main stat is 20, then invest four level up points, and place the remaining level up point elsewhere.<br>
			<br>DEX 14 – 14 DEX is absolutely crucial for melee combatants. 14 DEX gives 2 points into AC and +2 to initiative. Very important. If you’re planning on donning heavy armor then 14 DEX is the cap to how much AC you can get from DEX. Unless, of course, you have armor training and or wearing Mithral heavy armor. As both will increase how much AC you can derive from DEX.<br>
			<br>CON 10/12/14/16 – You want CON stat to be at an even number, as you only get bonuses from stat when it’s even. 10-12 is the bare minimum. 14 is the middle ground. And 16 is the ideal. The stats are even because CON isn’t our main stat, we won’t be investing ability points from level up into it. So it’s imperative you shoot for at least 12-14.<br>
			<br>INT – Unless you’re planning to multi class into a class that requires this stat then dump it. If you are planning on multi classing into a INT class, keep it at 10-12. (If you are playing a spellcaster and this is your main stat. Then advice from STR applies here. 17/19/20.)<br>
			<br>WIS 10/12/14 – 10 is the bare minimum. 12 is the middle ground, and 14 is the ideal.<br>
			<br>CHA – In Pathfinder: Kingmaker there are a lot of skill checks that require you to have decent CHA and ranks into persuasion. These checks often reward you with huge experience points. So keeping it at 10 is fine. However, in this game, companions can make the skill checks for you. Thus allowing you the freedom to dump it and specialize said companions into CHA and persuasion. Speaking of CHA there are also some builds and classes that require this stat, but like I said, you can always specialize companions into those kind of builds. (If you are playing a spellcaster and this is your main stat. Then advice from STR applies here. 17/19/20.)</p>
			<p>Example ranged martial:<br>
			Recommended stat distribution:<br>
			<br>STR 10/14/16 – If you are specializing into a composite longbow (Composite longbow add STR modifier to damage bonuses) then pump STR to 14. 16 is the ideal sweet spot if you can pump that far. If you are not planning to specialize into a composite longbow, then leave it at 10. Dumping STR is generally not recommended because it affects encumbrance, which affects how long you can travel on the world map before resting.<br>
			<br>DEX 17/19/20 – 17 is the bare minimum. 19 is the ideal, and 20 if you are not going to be dependent on other stats. Meaning you will be dumping STR, INT, and CHA.<br>
			<br>CON 10/12/14/16 – 10-12 is the bare minimum. 14 is the middle ground. And 16 is the ideal. Yes, this STAT is necessary for ranged users. Every once in a while you will get attacked, so having decent HP will help with that. Having decent CON also helps with fortitude saves as well.<br>
			<br>INT – Unless you’re planning to multi class into a class that requires this stat then dump it. If you are planning on multi classing into a INT class, keep it at 10-12.<br>
			<br>WIS – 10 is the bare minimum. 12 is the middle ground, and 14 is the ideal.<br>
			<br>CHA – If you don’t care about this stat then go ahead and dump it. Otherwise keep it at 10-12.</p>
			<p>Further information about the point buy system:
			<br>It costs 1 AP (Ability Point) to modify a stat from 10 to 13.
			<br>It costs 2 AP to modify a stat from 14 to 15.
			<br>It costs 3 AP to modify a stat from 16 to 17
			<br>It costs 4 AP to modify a stat to 18. (Racial bonuses allow you to go up to 20) </p>
