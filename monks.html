  			<h1 style="color: #393939">Monk Guide:</h1>
  			<p>Oi, traveler. Stay your blade and take up the fist instead. Consult this guide for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and become a monk!</p>
  			<p>Monks are true masters of both the physical and metaphysical. A feat not many can boast. Those who are monks are capable of harnessing their KI, the metaphysical, to perform spectacular achievements. Monks also spend years of their lives dedicated to honing their practical combat skills. Through dedication and sheer will power, monks are always ready to pull through when it matters! This guide will, hopefully, give you the knowledge you need to play the class competently.</p>
  			<h2 style="color: #393939">Key Features:</h2>
  			<p>Let's first discuss their features. Pathfinder: Kingmaker uses Unchained Monk. This version of the monk addresses many of the issues that the old version of monk suffered from, while also introducing some quality of life changes.</p>
  			<p>Full BAB - Unchained monk now has full base attack bonus. This now means that monk will have the same progression as fighter. BAB is important in that it determines your accuracy to hit, and how many attacks you can dish out per round. With full BAB and flurry of blows, a monk is capable of performing 8 attacks per round.</p>
  			<p>AC Bonus - When not wearing any armor, the monk adds his WIS to AC. The bonus is further increased by +1 at each four levels within the class, up to a maximum of +5 at level 20. This bonus is applied to touch AC as well.</p>
  			<p>Flurry of Blows - At level 1 a monk is capable of making consecutive attacks as a full attack. This basically means that the monk can perform one additional attack. Flurry of Blows gives an additional attack at level 11. These attacks are made at the highest BAB. These attacks stack with other effects that grant an additional attack.</p>
  			<p>KI Powers - The monk is able to pick a KI Power that will facilitate him to perform amazing physical feats. These powers can either be spell like abilities or innate passives. Most of the KI Power are not all that exciting. This is due to the fact that spells, scrolls, and wands; can provide the same effect as KI Powers. However, with that in mind, here are a few of my favorites: Bark Skin, True Strike, Abundant Step, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul.</p>
  			<p>KI Strike - These are primarily passives that apply to unarmed attacks in order to bypass DR. At level 3 unarmed attacks get treated as magic weapons. At level 7 unarmed attacks get treated as Cold Iron and Sliver. At level 10 unarmed gets treated as Lawful. Finally at level 16 unarmed gets treated as Adamantine.</p>
  			<p>Style Strikes - Whenever a monk makes a flurry of blows, one of the unarmed attacks can be treated as a style strike. These effects vary on the type you choose. Here is the list of style strikes:</p>
  			<p>Hammerblow: If this style strike hits, the monk rolls his unarmed damage twice. Both rolls are added before other modifiers. Basically, more damage. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
  			<p>Shattering Punch: A brutal punch that can bypass any DR or hardness that an enemy has.</p>
  			<p>Defensive Spin: If the monk lands a successful hit with this style strike, he then gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC until the next turn. Thid does not stack with itself.</p>
  			<p>Leg Sweep: If you attack with this style strike on, then you make a free trip attempt. The trip does not provoke AoO though.</p>
  			<h2 style="color: #393939">Recommended Stats:</h2>
  			<p>For DEX monks you can get away with dumping your INT, CHA, and STR. Leaving you with plenty of ability points. An optimal stat spread for a DEX monk would look like this:</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
				<li style="margin-top: -30px;">STR 7</li>
				<li>DEX 18</li>
				<li>CON 16</li>
				<li>INT 7</li>
				<li>WIS 18</li>
				<li>CHA 7</li>
			</ul>
			<p>One important thing to note for DEX based monks, is that you can dip 3 levels into the rogue class in order to do damage with fists. Finesse training is crucial for DEX based monks. If you do not want to dip three levels into rogue, there is an amulet called agile fists that allows you to apply your dexterity modifier to damage rolls, as long as you have the weapon finesse feat.</p>
			<p>For Strength monks you are limited to what you can dump. As you are dependent on lots of stats. An optimal stat spread for Strength monk would look like this:</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
				<li style="margin-top: -30px;">STR 19</li>
				<li>DEX 14</li>
				<li>CON 14</li>
				<li>INT 7</li>
				<li>WIS 16</li>
				<li>CHA 7</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="color: #393939">Recommended Races:</h2>
			<p>While any race can be a monk. Some races are going to be better at it than others. Such is life. Below are the best races I think will make for good monks:</p>
			<p>Human - This race gives a +2 to whatever ability score you choose, but the most important thing here, is that you can get an extra feat. This is invaluable. That extra feat can be used for better survivability, or to help finish the build early.</p>
			<p>Tiefling - Tieflngs come with heritages. These heritages provide you with +2 to two stats, but they each provide a unique passive. For example, Motherless adds a secondary bite attack, which can be used in conjunction with Flurry of Blows. Pitborn gains a +2 racial bonus on all rolls to confirm critical hits, quite useful. As you can see some of these passive can be quite helpful for monks.<p>
			<p>Aasimar - This race primarily gains a +2 to two stats, but gains some spell like abilities. These abilities can be very useful in the early game.</p>
			<p>Halfling - By far the best race in the game that makes for potent tank. This race gains +2 to both DEX and CHA. It also comes with halfling luck, which basically gives a +1 racial bonus on all saving throws. But the most important thing about this race is that it can qualify for Cautious Fighter. Cautious Fighter increase the bonus to dodge AC to +2 when fighting defensively. The reason why this is important is because it can stack with crane style.</p>
			<p>Dwarf - A niche race, but it's one my favorites. This race gains a +2 to CON and WIS. It also comes with hardy. Hardy gives a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell like abilities. The cool thing about the race, is that it can qualify you for Steel Soul. Steel Soul replaces hardy with a higher +4 racial bonus.</p>
			<h2 style="color: #393939">Recommended feats:</h2>
			<p>There are many feats in the game. However, here are the best feats that I think you should consider for your build - If you reach a point where you don't know which feats to pick, always go for utility based feats.</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">

				<li>Piranha Strike (For DEX based monks)</li>
				<li>Dodge</li>

			<p>Fun fact, insightful strike will get overrided if your strength bonus is higher than your WIS stat.</p>
			<p>Class progression:</p>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Level 1 - Sensei - Feats: Power Attack, Weapon Focus(Unarmed Strike), Deflect Arrows (Deflect Arrows is chosen because it's more optimal for the prologue. There are multiple archers in the prologue area. AC can easily be buffed with potions and spells. But being able to completely negate ranged users, is invaluable.) - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 2 - Sensei - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 3 - Sensei(It's very important to get three levels into monk as soon as you can. The reason being is due to KI Strike. The first KI Strike allows unarmed to be treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing Damage Reduction. Which is very important for unarmed users. Once you get three levels into monk, you can then start to multi class at level 4, if you wish.) - Feats: Dragon Style - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 4 + 1 CON - Fighter - Feats: Dodge(Dodge is chosen late because of several reasons 1)Sensei doesn't get an additional feat at level two. 2)Dragon Style is more important in order to increase unarmed damage) - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 5 - Fighter - Feats: Improved Initiative, Outflank (It should go without saying that fellow companions need to have Outflank. Either by level 5 or around level 6-8. You also need someone to be proficient in a high critical weapon in order to provoke Attack of Opportunities) - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>Level 6 - Sensei(You can go fighter or monk here. I like going monk for the KI Powers.) - KI Power: Barkskin - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 7 - Fighter - Feats: Dragon Ferocity - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 8 + 1 STR - Fighter - Feats: Vital Strike - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 9 - Sensei - Feats: Weapon Specialization(Unarmed) - Style Strike: Shattering Punch(This won't work with this build, because it requires flurry of blows. Sensei does not get flurry of blows.) - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
				<li>Level 10 - Sensei - KI Power: True Strike - Skills: Perception, Mobility.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
